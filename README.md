# Countries-of-the-World

## Overview

In this project, I explore [Countries of the Worlds Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) to answer the following questions in a blog post:

1. Wealthy vs. Poor Regions, What is the Difference?
2. What Can We Do to Limit Infant Mortality?
3. Machine Learning: What are the most significant predictors determining country's GDP per capita, the key indicator of economic development of any country?

This project was completed as part of Udacity's [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) certification.

## Data Origin

The dataset is the World's fact sheet including information on population, region, area size, infant mortality and more from [CIA World Factbook 2013](http://gsociology.icaap.org/dataupload.html).

The data comes from the US government and as stated in Their [website](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/faqs.html) it "may be used freely by anyone at anytime without seeking permission".
