When making visualisations related to countries, sometimes it is interesting to group them by attributes such as region, or weigh their importance by population, GDP or other variables.

In this project, I explore [Countries of the Worlds Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) to answer the following questions:

1. Wealthy vs. Poor Regions, What is the Difference?
2. What Can We Do to Limit Infant Mortality?
3. Machine Learning: What are the most significant predictors determining country's GDP per capita, the key indicator of economic development of any country?
